Description: HTTP 1.1 client module for Python
 The Python Dugong module provides an API for communicating with HTTP 1.1
 servers. It is an alternative to the standard library's http.client (formerly
 httplib) module. In contrast to http.client, Dugong:
 .
  * allows you to send multiple requests right after each other without having
    to read the responses first.
  * supports waiting for 100-continue before sending the request body.
  * raises an exception instead of silently delivering partial data if the
    connection is closed before all data has been received.
  * raises one specific exception (ConnectionClosed) if the connection has been
    closed (while http.client connection may raise any of BrokenPipeError,
    BadStatusLine, ConnectionAbortedError, ConnectionResetError, IncompleteRead
    or simply return '' on read)
  * supports non-blocking, asynchronous operation and is compatible with the
    asyncio module.
  * can in most cases distinguish between an unavailable DNS server and
    an unresolvable hostname.
  * is not compatible with old HTTP 0.9 or 1.0 servers.
 .
 All request and response headers are represented as str, but must be encodable
 in latin1. Request and response body must be bytes-like objects or binary
 streams.

Description: Python 3 bindings for the low-level FUSE API
 Python-llfuse is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE API.
 This package provides the extension for the Python 3 interpreter. The
 documentation is contained in the python-llfuse-doc package.
 .
 FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) is a simple interface for userspace
 programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE
 also aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to
 create and mount their own filesystem implementations.

Description: Full-featured file system for online data storage
 S3QL is a file system that stores all its data online using storage
 services like Google Storage, Amazon S3 or OpenStack. S3QL
 effectively provides a hard disk of dynamic, infinite capacity that
 can be accessed from any computer with internet access.
 .
 S3QL is a standard conforming, full featured UNIX file system that is
 conceptually indistinguishable from any local file
 system. Furthermore, S3QL has additional features like compression,
 encryption, data de-duplication, immutable trees and snapshotting
 which make it especially suitable for online backup and archival.
 .
 In addition to accessing online storage services directoly, S3QL can
 also store its data underneath a regular mount point. This enables
 the use of S3QL with e.g. NFS, CIFS or sftp servers.
 .
 S3QL is designed to favor simplicity and elegance over performance
 and feature-creep. Care has been taken to make the source code as
 readable and serviceable as possible. Solid error detection and error
 handling have been included from the very first line, and S3QL comes
 with extensive automated test cases.
