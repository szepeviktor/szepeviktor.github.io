Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.11 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 did, so has been renamed so that the
 previous version can continue to be made available.

Description: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
 Fail2ban monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,
 /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans
 failure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Fail2ban allows
 easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to ban an
 IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a
 notification email.
 .
 By default, it comes with filter expressions for various services
 (sshd, apache, qmail, proftpd, sasl etc.) but configuration can be
 easily extended for monitoring any other text file.  All filters and
 actions are given in the config files, thus fail2ban can be adopted
 to be used with a variety of files and firewalls.

Description: Sophisticated command-line FTP/HTTP/BitTorrent client programs
 Lftp is a file retrieving tool that supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS,
 FTPS and BitTorrent protocols under both IPv4 and IPv6. Lftp has an amazing
 set of features, while preserving its interface as simple and easy as possible.
 .
 The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability
 to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being
 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background
 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When
 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you
 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an
 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several
 ftp/http sites at the same time.
 .
 This package also includes lftpget - A simple non-interactive
 tool for downloading files.

Description: library implementing connection pooling for libmemcached
 libmemcached is a C and C++ client library to the memcached server
 (http://memcached.org/). It has been designed to be light on memory
 usage, thread safe, and provide full access to server side methods.
 .
 A few notes on its design:
 .
   * Synchronous and Asynchronous support.
   * Access to large object support.
   * Local replication.
   * TCP and Unix Socket protocols.
   * A half dozen or so different tuneable hash algorithms.
   * Implementations of the new cas, replace, and append operators.
   * Man pages written up on entire API.
   * Implements both modulo and consistent hashing solutions.
   * Tools to Manage your Memcached networks.
 .
 This package provides the libmemcachedutil library.

Description: fast compression/decompression library (development files)
 Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
 maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
 library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
 compression.
 .
 For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy
 is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting
 compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core
 of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250
 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.
 .
 This package contains the development files required to build programs
 against Snappy.

Description: Perl-based spam filter using text analysis
 SpamAssassin is a very powerful and fully configurable spam filter
 with numerous features including automatic white-listing, RBL
 testing, Bayesian analysis, header and body text analysis. It is
 designed to be called from a user's .procmail or .forward file, but
 can also be integrated into a Mail Transport Agent (MTA).
 .
 Included in this package is a daemonized form of spamassassin (spamd)
 which communicates with its client (spamc) via TCP, to reduce the
 overhead of loading perl with each message. To take advantage of
 this, you must install the spamc package.

Description: Client for SpamAssassin spam filtering daemon
 spamc is the client to communicate with spamd, the daemonized form of
 SpamAssassin (see the spamassassin package). It is written in C for
 maximum speed and minimum loading overhead.
 .
 spamc is quite useful for integrating spamassassin into an MTA or
 into a .procmailrc file because of its speed.
 .
 This package is useless unless you have spamassassin installed,
 either on this machine or another local machine (i.e. a mail server).

Description: Micro Name Service Caching Daemon
 A daemon which handles passwd, group and host lookups for running
 programs and caches the results for the next query. You only need
 this package if you are using slow Name Services like LDAP, NIS or
 NIS+.
 .
 This particular NSCD is a complete rewrite of the GNU glibc nscd
 which is a single threaded server process which offloads all NSS
 lookups to worker children; cache hits are handled by the parent,
 and only cache misses start worker children, making the parent immune
 to resource leaks, hangs, and crashes in NSS libraries.
 .
 It should mostly be a drop-in replacement for existing installs using
 nscd.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.
