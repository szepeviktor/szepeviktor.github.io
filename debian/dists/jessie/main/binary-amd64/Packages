Description: Versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol
 It consists of a pair of programs:
 .
 chronyd:  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.
 It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems and adjusts the system time accordingly. For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by
 hand (using 'chronyc'). In either case 'chronyd' determines the rate
 at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or
 a server.
 .
 chronyc: This is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within
 the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running.

Description: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
 Fail2ban monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,
 /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans
 failure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Fail2ban
 allows easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to ban
 an IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a notification
 email.
 .
 By default, it comes with filter expressions for various services
 (sshd, apache, qmail, proftpd, sasl etc.) but configuration can be
 easily extended for monitoring any other text file.  All filters and
 actions are given in the config files, thus fail2ban can be adopted
 to be used with a variety of files and firewalls.  Following recommends
 are listed:
 .
  - iptables -- default installation uses iptables for banning. You most
    probably need it
  - whois -- used by a number of *mail-whois* actions to send notification
    emails with whois information about attacker hosts. Unless you will use
    those you don't need whois
  - python3-pyinotify -- unless you monitor services logs via systemd, you
    need pyinotify for efficient monitoring for log files changes

 applications and the PHP core. Suhosin comes in two independent parts, that
 can be used separately or in combination. The first part is a small patch
 against the PHP core, that implements a few low-level protections against
 bufferoverflows or format string vulnerabilities and the second part is a
 powerful PHP extension that implements all the other protections.

Description: HTTP 1.1 client module for Python
 The Python Dugong module provides an API for communicating with HTTP 1.1
 servers. It is an alternative to the standard library's http.client (formerly
 httplib) module. In contrast to http.client, Dugong:
 .
  * allows you to send multiple requests right after each other without having
    to read the responses first.
  * supports waiting for 100-continue before sending the request body.
  * raises an exception instead of silently delivering partial data if the
    connection is closed before all data has been received.
  * raises one specific exception (ConnectionClosed) if the connection has been
    closed (while http.client connection may raise any of BrokenPipeError,
    BadStatusLine, ConnectionAbortedError, ConnectionResetError, IncompleteRead
    or simply return '' on read)
  * supports non-blocking, asynchronous operation and is compatible with the
    asyncio module.
  * can in most cases distinguish between an unavailable DNS server and
    an unresolvable hostname.
  * is not compatible with old HTTP 0.9 or 1.0 servers.

 All request and response headers are represented as str, but must be encodable
 in latin1. Request and response body must be bytes-like objects or binary
 streams.

Description: Full-featured file system for online data storage
 S3QL is a file system that stores all its data online using storage
 services like Google Storage, Amazon S3 or OpenStack. S3QL
 effectively provides a hard disk of dynamic, infinite capacity that
 can be accessed from any computer with internet access.
 .
 S3QL is a standard conforming, full featured UNIX file system that is
 conceptually indistinguishable from any local file
 system. Furthermore, S3QL has additional features like compression,
 encryption, data de-duplication, immutable trees and snapshotting
 which make it especially suitable for online backup and archival.
 .
 In addition to accessing online storage services directoly, S3QL can
 also store its data underneath a regular mount point. This enables
 the use of S3QL with e.g. NFS, CIFS or sftp servers.
 .
 S3QL is designed to favor simplicity and elegance over performance
 and feature-creep. Care has been taken to make the source code as
 readable and serviceable as possible. Solid error detection and error
 handling have been included from the very first line, and S3QL comes
 with extensive automated test cases.

Description: Perl-based spam filter using text analysis
 SpamAssassin is a very powerful and fully configurable spam filter
 with numerous features including automatic white-listing, RBL
 testing, Bayesian analysis, header and body text analysis. It is
 designed to be called from a user's .procmail or .forward file, but
 can also be integrated into a Mail Transport Agent (MTA).
 .
 Included in this package is a daemonized form of spamassassin (spamd)
 which communicates with its client (spamc) via TCP, to reduce the
 overhead of loading perl with each message. To take advantage of
 this, you must install the spamc package.

Description: Client for SpamAssassin spam filtering daemon
 spamc is the client to communicate with spamd, the daemonized form of
 SpamAssassin (see the spamassassin package). It is written in C for
 maximum speed and minimum loading overhead.
 .
 spamc is quite useful for integrating spamassassin into an MTA or
 into a .procmailrc file because of its speed.
 .
 This package is useless unless you have spamassassin installed,
 either on this machine or another local machine (i.e. a mail server).
